   <li>Extract the zip file (some browsers may do this automatically). <br>
    <li> Double-click to open the app. If you get a security error (GateKeeper), you can try right clicking, and selecting Open, which should give you an additional "Open" option in the popup. <br>
     <li>Either add your BIOS files to '[home directory]/Library/Application Support/AetherSX2/bios', or change the BIOS path in settings. <br>
    <li>Add a directory from the settings menu to scan for games. Don't select your home directory or the root of any external volumes, it'll take forever. Pick the directory with your game dumps. <br>
    <li>Launch game and enjoy. <br>
